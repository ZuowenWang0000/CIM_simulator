UZH: 
1. FPGA

IMEC
1. Viper-box
    -> base board. It has a house-keeping FPGA (don't know the board). The board connects to the host cpu over usb.
    - connects UZH's FPGA SPI to the headstage
    - deserializer <-> serializer pair. connects viper-box and headstage with thin 3 differential cables. (power, box-to-headstage(stimulation), headstage-to-box(recordings))
    - 3 modes of operation
        1. host cpu controls everything using usb
        2. host cpu initializes the system, and then UZH's FGPA controls the headstage (initialization and commands)
        3. (not there yet) the box self-initializes, and UZH's FPGA controls the headstage (initialization and commands)
